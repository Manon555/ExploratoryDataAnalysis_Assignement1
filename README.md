# ExploratoryDataAnalysis_Assignment1: R code and plots of Exploratory Data Analysis assignment for week 1

# This project containts a zipped data set, four R scripts for creating plots (plot1.R, plot2.R, ...) and four plots (plot1.png, plot2.png, ...)

# Each script contains the code for unzipping, loading and reformatting the data table in Part 1 and the code for creating the plot in Part 2

# Description of the data set and variables:
# Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. 
# Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
# The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
# - Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
# - Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
# - Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
# - Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
# - Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
# - Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
# - Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
# - Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
# - Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
